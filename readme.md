# bladerunnered-basic

Initial implementation of https://github.com/derekr/bladerunnered

Basically the concept is:

```
blade runner soundtrack +
sound of rain +
SF police scanner live stream

=> Productivity by way of feeling like a future detective in SF
```

Based on this initial [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/3bt87u/san_francisco_bladerunner/)
